# Q1

A packet contains a **header** (which stores the address or destination of a packet) and a **payload** (which stores the data or message).

# Q2

The **internet layer** describes the protocols for how networks inter connect with each other and the way that computers are identified. A client may need to specify parameters such as the IP address.

# Q3

The **transport layer** provides an abstraction for those two process to appear as if they are communicating directly with each other. It also differentiates communication destined for different processes through **ports**, which the client needs to specify.

# Q4

- **SMTP** *(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)* is a protocol for managing **e-mail**.
- **HTTP** *(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)* was originally used for transferring hypertext over the web, but now handles more data types (e.g. multimedia).

# Q5

An **IP *(internel protocol)* address** is a number that acts as a unique identifier of the device in the network. However, it is difficult for humans to these IP numbers for every single device they would need to connect to, so a **domain name** - a dotted string of names ending in a TLD *(top level domain)* - can be used to identify devices. The Internet functions on IP addresses, not domain names, so a separate protocol called DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.

# Q6

While the IP address is used to deliver packets to a destination computer, the **port address** is used to deliver the packets on the computer to the right process. The port address is a way for the OS to divide up the arriving network data based on the destination process.

# Q7

```java
Socket socket = null;
try{
    socket = new Socket("123.45.678.900", 4040);
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
    pw.println("Yellow");
    pw.close();
    socket.close();
}catch(Exception e){}
```

# Q8

A Java `Socket`'s **output stream** can be used to write to the server and **input stream** can listen to the server's response.

# Q9

In a two-way communication with a server, the `Socket` class is used as the client socket, and the `ServerSocket` is used as the ServerSocket. A `Socket` object is constructed with the IP address and port number, while `ServerSocket` only needs the port number.

# Q10

A threaded socket server starts a new thread for each incoming client connection. That way, the main thread can continue to listen to new incoming connections, while the threads the handle server-to-1-client communication and perform the actual logic.
